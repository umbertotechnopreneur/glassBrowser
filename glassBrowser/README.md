# Fake GlassBrowser based on Vue.js+Vuetify 3
Since we were bored to present our screenshots in billions of different ways, here at umbertogiacobbi.biz we decided (we need to show some screens for our aginti.it project) to create our own "fake" next-gen super cool glassmoriphism browser.

Download it, the background images changes randomly at each load (see them in the backgrounds folder) so each time you have a different background.

To change the "browser content just change the **yourScreenshot.jpg** file you'll find in the images folder.

The aim is not only make it static but also dynamic in case you need to record a short video for a demo.

I keep it as basic as possible using only CSS.

Feel free to reuse it, improve it or whatever.
