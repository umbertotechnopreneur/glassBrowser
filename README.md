# Fake GlassBrowser based on Vue.js+Vuetify 3
Since we were bored to present our screenshots in billions of different ways, here at [umbertogiacobbi.biz](https://umbertogiacobbi.biz) we decided (we need to show some screens for our [aginti.it](https://aginti.it) project) to create our own "fake" next-gen super cool glassmoriphism browser.

This is a simple **vVue3 + Vuetify3** node.js project so is meant to run locally.

Download it, the background images changes randomly at each load (see them in the backgrounds folder) so each time you have a different background.

To change the "browser content just change the **yourScreenshot.jpg** file you'll find in the images folder.

The aim is not only make it static but also dynamic in case you need to record a short video for a demo.

Some random ideas that someone could come up and fix:

 - Support dark/light theme, there is a button in the toolbar but does nothing
 - If I had any other idea I will write here...

I keep it as basic as possible using only CSS.

Feel free to reuse it, improve it or whatever.
